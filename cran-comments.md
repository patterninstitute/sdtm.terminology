* This is a new release.
* This is an R data package providing the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Standard Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) controlled terminology, 2025-03-25.
* Package version is using calendar versioning. I hope that's okay as that is how upstream data is versioned, so it will be more intuitive for users this way.
* Compared to the previous submission, I've fixed: (i) leading zero in package version, and (ii) the missing dependency on R >= 4.1.0.
